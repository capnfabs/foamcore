# Foamcore

Making organiser boxes out of foamcore [^music] is loads of fun; all you need is:

- foamboard
- a sharp knife
- a bunch of small pins
- craft glue.

[^music]: it sounds like a siiiiick music genre but it's not

But! Getting the measurements right is a little fiddly, and it's annoying to try and guess how many sheets you're going to need. So: here's a vibe-coded app.


## Next things to add:

(1) - styles.
    - Two-column layout on desktop with calcs appearing on the right.
    - make it look like a technical drawing
(2) - collapsible settings
